rot13 addon for Friendica
==========================

**Do not use this addon for anythin serious!**
It is only meant as demonstration for how to write an addon for Friendica.

The purpose of this addon is to apply the [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) substitution code to aa send posting, if activated.
This has nothing to do with security.
It is just something for fun.

Applying ROT13 to a posting in this way will interfere with remdering of BBCode elements in the postings.
Also, as ROT13 is only applied to a certain set of characters (US ASCII) some characters will remain as they are (e.g. special characters or German umlaute).
